# endian
Endian is a cross-platform, general-purpose c++ little endian/big endian solution that eliminates the need for users to explicitly specify the conversion mode each time they access different endian data.  Once you declare a variable using a type in Endian, you don't need to specify any explicit conversion for it, just use it as if it were a standard type supported by the CPU.
